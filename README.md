Ghost blog using docker compose

Following the guide _"Hosting a Ghost blog with NGINX and Docker"_ from Alistair Chapman:

* Part 2: https://blog.agchapman.com/ghost-blog-with-nginx-and-docker-2/

## Problems I came across

### SSL companion

#### Docker socket missing

Setting up the ssl companion like this:

```
  ssl-companion:
    image: jrcs/letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion
    container_name: ssl-companion
    volumes:
      - /apps/web/ssl:/etc/nginx/certs:rw # same path as above, now RW
    volumes_from:
      - proxy
```

Left me with the error:\
`ssl-companion | Error: you need to share your Docker host socket with a volume at /var/run/docker.sock`.\
As suggested [here](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion/issues/87#issuecomment-235324412) I've added the volume:\
`/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro`

#### CA authorization invalid

After ghost was running (as docker said), I couldn't access it via registered domain. So I've restarted the nginx & ssl-companion to see this error:
```
ssl-companion    | 2020-04-30 15:32:35,816:ERROR:simp_le:1417: CA marked some of the authorizations as invalid, which likely means it could not access http://example.com/.well-known/acme-challenge/X. Did you set correct path in -d example.com:path or --default_root? Are all your domains accessible from the internet? Please check your domains' DNS entries, your host's network/firewall setup and your webserver config. If a domain's DNS entry has both A and AAAA fields set up, some CAs such as Let's Encrypt will perform the challenge validation over IPv6. If your DNS provider does not answer correctly to CAA records request, Let's Encrypt won't issue a certificate for your domain (see https://letsencrypt.org/docs/caa/). Failing authorizations: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/acme/authz-v3/4276342995
```
Well... obviously, since I couldn't ping the new domain and neither could some online service. I've added the subdomain some days ago, so it should be accessible. But now I've discovered, that the second-level-domain had a different name server attached. I thought this would not have any effect, but sure it did. After adding the 4th level domain to this service, the DNS is working correctly. The domain is currently `staging.3rdlevel.2ndlevel.tld` shaped.

### Maria DB

I came across this error: `db_1    | mkdir: cannot create directory '/bitnami/mariadb': Permission denied`.\
Using this volume:

```
    volumes:
      - /var/docker/ghost/mariadb-persistence:/bitnami
```

So I've ran `/var/docker/ghost$ sudo chmod -R 777 mariadb-persistence/`.\
There might be a better way, which I might figure out some other time.

### Ghost

#### DB connection error

This error occured: `blog_1  | Error executing 'postInstallation': Failed to connect to mariadb:3306 after 36 tries`.\
Manually adding the hostname `mariadb` to the container fixed the issue:
```
services:
  mariadb:
    image: 'bitnami/mariadb:latest'
    environment:
      - HOSTNAME=mariadb
```

#### DB access failure

Now, the connection was successful but ghost couldn't login to maria db server:
```
blog_1     | mysql-c INFO  Found MySQL server listening at mariadb:3306
mariadb_1  | 2020-04-30 14:46:30 9 [Warning] Access denied for user 'bn_ghost'@'172.19.0.3' (using password: NO)
blog_1     | mysql-c ERROR [canConnect] Connection with 'bn_ghost' user is unsuccessful
```

An environment information with the DB password fixed this:
```
      - GHOST_DATABASE_PASSWORD=
```

#### Aborted DB connections

After ghost configured itself and created the admin user, the following warnings occurred:
```
[...]
blog_1     | ghost   INFO  ==> Creating admin user...
blog_1     | ghost   INFO  The admin user was created
mariadb_1  | 2020-04-30 15:12:07 31 [Warning] Aborted connection 31 to db: 'bitnami_ghost' user: 'bn_ghost' host: '172.19.0.3' (Got an error reading communication packets)

```
_Not fixed yet._ **UPDATE:** The errors did not show up again but I think I force-recreated the containers in the meantime. I guess some not completed setup process might have caused this.

#### Directory permission denied

Some time after the initialization and the abroted connection warnings, this one came up:\
`blog_1     | Error executing 'postInstallation': EACCES: permission denied, mkdir '/bitnami/ghost'`

So I've granted too many permissions to the persistence volume mount:\
`/var/docker/ghost$ sudo chmod -R 777 ghost-persistence/`

But this just lead to another error with instant container crash:
```
blog_1     | Error executing 'postInstallation': ELOOP: too many symbolic links encountered, lstat '/opt/bitnami/ghost/logs/ghost.log'
ghost_blog_1 exited with code 1
```

This was indeed easily fixed by shutting the containers down and bringing them up again - instead of just restarting the previous, crashed one:
```
/var/docker/ghost$ docker-compose down
Removing ghost_blog_1    ... done
Removing ghost_mariadb_1 ... done
Removing network ghost_default
/var/docker/ghost$ docker-compose up
```

So now, I've got to this point:
```
blog_1     | - Starting Ghost: 172-20-0-3
blog_1     | âœ” Starting Ghost: 172-20-0-3
blog_1     |
blog_1     | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
blog_1     |
blog_1     | Your admin interface is located at:
blog_1     |
blog_1     |     http://172.20.0.3/ghost/
```

### Nginx

#### No live upstreams

After all the above problems where fixed, trying to access the domain lead to:
```
nginx-proxy      | nginx.1    | 2020/05/01 18:47:55 [error] 175#175: *44 no live upstreams while connecting to upstream, client: 188.xxx.xxx.xxx, server: staging.3rdlevel.2ndlevel.tld, request: "GET / HTTP/2.0", upstream: "http://staging.3rdlevel.2ndlevel.tld/", host: "staging.3rdlevel.2ndlevel.tld"
```

Checking the nginx config in the container tells me, that the exposed port of ghost, in my case `2368` seems not to be used.\
Config location: `/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf`.\
As of the guide, which states that _By default, the config will point at the only port that the blog service exposes: 2368_ it should work.

As of my investigation, this problem seems to be caused by multiple different networks. I've now defined the `web` network at the nginx' `docker-compose.yml`:

```
services:
  proxy:
    image: jwilder/nginx-proxy
    [...]
    networks:
      - web
      
[...]

networks:
  web:
    driver: bridge
```

Unfortunately, it seems that docker does not allow simple networks. According to [this stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/38089080/2414736), I have to prefix the network wherever I want to use it again and define it as external network. I have done this over at the `docker-compose.yml` of ghost and mariadb:

```
version: '2'
services:
  mariadb:
    image: 'bitnami/mariadb:latest'
    [...]
    networks:
      - nginx_web
  blog:
    image: 'bitnami/ghost:latest'
    [...]
    networks:
      - nginx_web

networks:
  nginx_web:
    external: true
```

I took down both the nginx- and ghost-setup via `docker-compose down` and booted them up again with `docker-compose up`.

### Ghost

#### Unable to login

So now was the first time I was able to visit the landing page. Unfortunately I could not login at `staging.3rdlevel.2ndlevel.tld/ghost`. No registration showed up, either. Maybe - at some point - the initial passwort of the unknown auto-generated admin user was shown but I missed it. Since I wanted to keep the initial setup, I decided to just set a new password to the admin user, following [this guide](https://lengerrong.blogspot.com/2017/10/reset-user-password-for-your-own-ghost.html):

* Get the database container name via `$ docker ps`, in my case `ghost_mariadb_1`
* Get a shell inside the container: `$ docker exec -it ghost_mariadb_1 /bin/bash`
* Access the datatabse: `mysql -u bn_ghost -p` and enter the password, defined in the `docker-compose.yml` as `MARIADB_PASSWORD`
* Switch to the `MARIADB_DATABASE`: `> use bitnami_ghost;`
* _Optional: To have a quick overview of the DB, I usually want to see all tables via `> show tables;`_
* As we can see, we have a `users` table, so: `> select * from users;`
* Two users with the following emails are defined in my case: `user@example.com` and `ghost-author@example.com`
* Now create a new password string over here: http://bcrypthashgenerator.apphb.com/
* Set the new password via:\
`> update users set password='$2b$10$qwBTvVowrGyrYwPCK3CNKe482C/19XgPreTcpwU/sEjFA6Ra1G/TG' where email='user@example.com';`
* My login page now said, that I've tried to login too many times. Having seen the tables, I noticed the `brute` table. Flushing it made it possible to login:
`> delete from brute;`

After the login worked, make sure to set yourself a new password. Also set a new password to the other, automatically created user

#### Docker IP as URL

The ghost admin backend was showing the local docker IP as URL, for example `http://172.28.0.4/tag/getting-started/` at Settings â†’ Design and also in article links or as hint text in input fields. 

To change this for the whole application I've followed [these steps](https://ghost.org/faq/change-configured-site-url/):
* Get the blog container name via `$ docker ps`, in my case `ghost_blog_1`
* Get a shell inside the container: `$ docker exec -it ghost_blog_1 /bin/bash`
* The ghost CLI should be available: `$ ghost --version` (i.e. `Ghost-CLI version: 1.13.1`)
* Set your URL via: `$ ghost config url https://some.blog.2ndlevel.tld`
* Restart ghost via `$ ghost restart`

Now check the backend by refreshing the Settings â†’ Design page. The IPs should be replaced by your URL.

----

So, now - I think I'm ready to test the software itself now.\
I still need to
- fix the permissions on the host system - maybe via a pre-executed docker-compose script
- get the docker-compose config files as light-weight as possible
- switch to more fixed versions of the images to avoid complications on updates
- write down the update procedures or at least link to how-to's
- add backup mechanisms to another machine
